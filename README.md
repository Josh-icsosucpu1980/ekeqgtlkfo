# Antes del Cuerpo: Notes from the Edge

---

## Perspective: An Experienced Stuntman

Alright, settle in. Been in this game for twenty-five years. Seen things, felt things. Got the roadmap of my career mapped out in scar tissue. When the script for Antes del Cuerpo landed, the title... it just hit different. "Before the Body." Yeah. That's it. That's the whole damn job, if you strip it down.

It ain't about the crash, the fall, the fire. Not really. Those are just... milliseconds of execution. The spectacle. The real work, the grit, the calculation, the controlled fear â€“ that's all Antes del Cuerpo. It's what happens before the body goes through hell.

## The Project: Antes del Cuerpo

This film, the director's vision... intense. It requires pushing boundaries, but that's the gig. They wanted realism, they wanted impact. And for that, they needed people who live and breathe the 'before'.

My involvement focused on several key sequences, but there was one... one that encapsulated the title perfectly for me.

## The Work: A Specific Sequence

Picture this: A multi-story fall through a complex set piece, requiring precise timing with pyrotechnics and debris. Not just a straight drop. It involved navigating a partial collapse, a controlled slide down a rafter, and then a significant fall through something fragile (looked like old skylight glass), landing accurately on the catch system below, while controlled fire burst around the impact zone.

### Complexity Factors:

   Height: Significant, increasing fall velocity and impact forces.
   Obstacles: Navigating the collapse and rafter slide required choreography mid-fall.
   Accuracy: Landing zone was specific due to the surrounding set and effects.
   SFX Timing: Pyrotechnics needed to coincide with my body's passage and landing for visual effect, but safely away from me.

This wasn't a 'point and jump'. This was a finely tuned ballet of controlled chaos.

## Antes del Cuerpo: The Preparation

This is where Antes del Cuerpo lives. Not when the camera rolls. Long before.

### 1. The Analysis

   Reading the script pages until they were soft. Understanding the character's motivation (pain, desperation, escape). This informs the feel of the movement.
   Breaking down the action beat by beat with the stunt coordinator, Maria. Her eye for detail is unmatched.
   Consulting with the director, Anya, to understand the exact shot angles, the pace, the emotional arc. How should this fall feel to the audience?

### 2. The Planning & Engineering

   Working with the rigging team. Where do the wires go? What's the backup? How is the catch system (layers of specialized airbags) configured for this specific fall, this specific angle?
   Calculating trajectories. Wind factors. The exact angle of departure. The timing of the slide on the rafter.
   Mapping the debris path. Ensuring none of it ends up in my landing zone or, worse, attached to me.
   Coordinating exactly with the SFX supervisor for the fire bursts. Safe distances. Blast duration. The cue.

### 3. The Gear

   Checking my harness. Every stitch. Every buckle. It's my life insurance.
   My pads. Strategic, minimal, hidden under costume, but vital.
   The costume itself. Does it snag? Does it restrict movement? Can I see? (Surprisingly important).

### 4. The Rehearsals

   Walking through the sequence slowly. On the ground first. Marking steps.
   Rigged walk-throughs at lower heights. Feeling the pull of the wire. Practicing the slide.
   Dummy runs. Using a weighted dummy to test the rigging, the trajectory, the catch system, and the SFX timing before a human body ever goes over. You learn more from watching that dummy fall than you do from anything else sometimes.

### 5. The Wait

   Top of the set. Looking down. The controlled environment suddenly feels very real, very high.
   Blocking out the noise. The crew setting up, the wind.
   Going internal. Running the sequence in my head. Visualizing every micro-movement. Where my hands are. My body position. The feel of the rafter. The moment I transition to freefall. The tuck. The impact. The roll off the bag.

### 6. The Breath

   That final moment before "Action!". Taking a deep breath. Slow. Controlled.
   A final check of the wire tension (you can feel it). A nod to the rigger holding my life in their hands. A look to the coordinator for the final "You good?".
   Everything narrows down to this single point in time and space. The body is poised. The mind is locked on.

## The Execution

"ACTION!"

It's a blur of trained reflexes. Muscle memory takes over, guided by the mental blueprint meticulously crafted Antes del Cuerpo. The step off. The controlled angle. The slide. The release. The wind rush. The sound of the breaking glass just where it was planned. The heat from the fire just far enough away. The controlled impact. The practiced roll.

It's fast. Violent. But precise.

---

## Aftermath

"CUT!"

Silence. Dust settles. The lingering smell of pyrotechnics.

Getting up. Checking the limbs. A thumbs-up to the crew. Walking it off. The adrenaline dump is real.

It's done. The body performed.

## Why "Antes del Cuerpo" Matters

The fall? That was maybe three seconds. The before? Days. Weeks. A lifetime of learning.

The body is just the vessel. The meat suit that takes the impact. But it's the mind, the planning, the preparation, the trust in the team, the absolute focus before you commit the body â€“ that's what gets you through. Antes del Cuerpo. It's the unseen work that makes the seen possible. It's the safety. It's the professionalism.

This film title isn't just a cool name. It's a principle. For us, it's the only way to survive.

## Looking Back

Great working on Antes del Cuerpo. Challenging sequences, solid planning, fantastic crew. Everyone understood the assignment, understood the importance of the 'before'.

Yeah. That title resonates. Loud and clear.
